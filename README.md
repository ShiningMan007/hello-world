# hello-world
This is my first repository in githut...

What should I write in this hello-world bench... How about keep track of the life today...

Dec 17th/ 2016   These days are really busy, I have so many examinations to code with, each examination is only 1 or two days 
far away from other. I quite am exhausted... But I feel something wonderful. I now can try to finish all of the homework now.
Last semester, I would not have this energy or spent my time to accomplish homework...

The other wonderful thing is... Actually, I don't want to say this, it's really difficult to get along with a girl... I don't 
know whether I can achieve this, what I can do now may be try best.. But to be honestly, keeping a un-determining relationship 
is really exhausting...
